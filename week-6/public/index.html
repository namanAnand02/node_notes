    - - - - - summary of signin function - - - - - 
    ++ signin() function --> it is to hit back at the /signin endpoint -> using axios
    ++ /signin endpoints requires username and password that this function sends alongside in axios.
    ++ /signin endpoint matches the details and generates the token and return to the user so that the user could use that token, next time he tries to hit any other endpoints like /me, etc.
    ++ we need to store that token in the localStorage so that it could be used by the user next time at other endpoints.
    ++ localStorage.setItem("token", response.data.token)
    
    ++ doing this wlll help token persists on the user's browser until he logs out. 
    meaning, once he sign in and we store the token into the localStorage, this token persists long until he logs out (his session remains until he logs out). 
    
    ++ all we need to handle is that- whenever that user hits any other endpoints after signin, the token gets sent alongside so that he gets to benefit from those other endpoints.


    ++ and yes, we at last alert the user that he signed in.

<!-- create a full stack application

 1. signup

<!-- 
Writing the onclick handlers 

1. Add the axios library
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/axios/1.7.7/axios.min.js"></script>
-
-
-


2. Write the signup function

- it hits the signup endpoint at the backend - sends the username and password that the user puts, and also it reponds back to the user that they signed up.


- first we need to extract the username and password from the input tag
- we can do that using DOM, assign id first to them, then use getElementById(...).value()
-
-
-


3. Write the signin function
4. Write the logout function
5. Write the getUserInformation function




// NEXT IMP STEP : HOST FRONTEND locally

// we want to host frontend part locally too like on some endpoints (basically on a similar url like backend)
// we will do it using backend codebase

// in our backend itself, among the various other endpoints - we will add another endpoint "/", hitting which will solely run the frontend on that url 
// i.e on get "/" endpoint, we sendFile(our frontend complete directory)

// we are returning frontend also from our backend.
// we want to host our frontend and backend from the same domain -> to avoid some complexity that comes with CORS, etc.


// frontend hosted at "/" get endpoint so that anytime someone hits localhost:3000, backend not sends them any json but full frontend file contents to them.
app.get("/", function(req,res){
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html")

    // __dirname -> global method to get the current directory 
    // current directory is "C:\Users\NAMAN\Desktop\100_ cohort3\week-6"  + /index.html
